            <p>The Western and Central Africa - West Africa Food System Resilience Program (FSRP) aims to establish a sustainable platform to strengthen Africa’s
                capacity for effective policy research and evidence-based policymaking on cross-boundary priorities.
            </p>

            <p>Funded by the World Bank and implemented by the African Union Commission, the platform seeks to support
                and connect African FSRP partners working on critical continental issues, including economic
                transformation, climate change, trade integration, food security, human capital development, and
                digitalization, with a strong emphasis on gender and regional collaboration.
            <p>We are inviting applications from consortia of African FSRP partners to apply for funding under the FSRP.
                Selected consortia will contribute to the platform’s core mission by producing high-quality research,
                engaging in policy dialogue, and strengthening institutional capacity to inform continental
                policymaking.
